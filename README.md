#    <center> The Jazz Lounge v2


// Project started 10/7/2020 //

I wrote this site from scratch originally using pure PHP, HTML5 and CSS. I
decided it was time to update it a bit (mostly the front end), and as a way
to force myself to learn something new, decided to use the Symfony framework
this time around.

Symfony seems extremely popular nowadays, and I love the fact that they are
completely open source. Symfony also seems to have a very active community,
with no shortage of information on how to get the job done.

You can find the Symfony repo hosted right here on Github ([link](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)).
