#    <center> The Jazz Lounge v2


// Project started 10/7/2020 //

I wrote this site from scratch originally using pure PHP, HTML5 and CSS. I
decided it was time to update it a bit (mostly the front end), and as a way
to force myself to learn something new, decided to use the Symfony framework
this time around.

Symfony seems extremely popular nowadays, and I love the fact that they are
completely open source. Symfony also seems to have a very active community,
with no shortage of information on how to get the job done.

As for this site, it will have the following functions:

- Browse a paginated list of products (albums) pulled from a database (MySQL)
  with links to add items to the user's shopping cart

- View your shopping cart, make edits to the cart, calculate total 
  cost (plus shipping)

- Register an account on the site with email and password

- Log in / log out of user account

- Checkout items in cart (gather shipping/billing info)

- Order processing (generate recepit, email confirmation of order)


You can find the Symfony repo hosted right here on Github ([link](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)).
